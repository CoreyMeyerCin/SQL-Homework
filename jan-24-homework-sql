-- CHAPTER 6 EXERCISES
-----------------------------------------
--1. Turn this code into a subquery with the same results
--SELECT DISTINCT VendorName 
--FROM Vendors JOIN Invoices
--	ON Vendors.VendorID = Invoices.VendorID 
--ORDER BY VendorName;

--SELECT VendorName
--FROM Vendors
--WHERE VendorID IN
--	(SELECT VendorId
--	FROM Invoices)
--ORDER BY VendorName;

--2. Write a SELECT statement that answers this question: 
--Which invoices have a PaymentTotal that’s greater than 
--the average PaymentTotal for all paid invoices? Return 
--the InvoiceNumber and InvoiceTotal for each 

--SELECT InvoiceNumber, InvoiceTotal
--FROM Invoices
--WHERE PaymentTotal >
--	(SELECT AVG(PaymentTotal)
--	FROM Invoices)

--3. Write a SELECT statement that answers this question: 
--Which invoices have a PaymentTotal that’s greater than the 
--median PaymentTotal for all paid invoices? (The median marks 
--the midpoint in a set of values; an equal number of values lie 
--above and below it.) Return the InvoiceNumber and InvoiceTotal 
--for each invoice.
--Hint: Begin with the solution to exercise 2, then use the ALL 
--keyword in the WHERE clause and code “TOP 50 PERCENT PaymentTotal” 
--in the subquery

--SELECT InvoiceNumber, InvoiceTotal
--FROM Invoices
--WHERE PaymentTotal > ALL
--	(SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT PaymentTotal
--	FROM Invoices
--	--Added this where line after seeing answer, PaymentTotal <> 0 exists because it has to 
--	--be a 'Paid invoice' so if it equaled '0' then it would not have been paid
--	WHERE PaymentTotal <>0
--	ORDER BY PaymentTotal)

--4. Write a SELECT statement that returns two columns 
--from the GLAccounts table: AccountNo and AccountDescription. 
--The result set should have one row for each account number that 
--has never been used. Use a correlated subquery introduced with 
--the NOT EXISTS operator. Sort the final result set by AccountNo.

--SELECT AccountNo, AccountDescription
--FROM GLAccounts
--WHERE NOT EXISTS
--	(SELECT *
--	FROM InvoiceLineItems
--	--Made a mistake here doing GlAccounts.AccountNo <> InvoiceLineItems.AccountNo
--	--Which is funny because that would give us the EXACT opposite results of what we needed
--	WHERE GLAccounts.AccountNo =InvoiceLineItems.AccountNo)
--ORDER BY AccountNo

--5. Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns: 
--VendorName, InvoiceID, InvoiceSequence, and InvoiceLineItemAmount 
--for each invoice that has more than one line item in the InvoiceLineItems table.
--Hint: Use a subquery that tests for InvoiceSequence > 1.

--SELECT VendorName, i.InvoiceID, ili.InvoiceSequence, ili.InvoiceLineItemAmount
--FROM Vendors AS v 
--	JOIN Invoices as i ON v.VendorID = i.VendorID
--	JOIN InvoiceLineItems AS ili ON i.InvoiceID = ili.InvoiceID
--WHERE i.InvoiceID IN
--	(SELECT ili.InvoiceID
--	FROM InvoiceLineItems 
--	WHERE ili.InvoiceSequence >1 )
--ORDER BY VendorName, i.InvoiceID, InvoiceSequence;

--6.Write a SELECT statement that returns a single value that 
--represents the sum of the largest unpaid invoices submitted 
--by each vendor. Use a derived table that returns MAX(InvoiceTotal) 
--grouped by VendorID, filtering for invoices with a balance due


--In this question there are a few tricks. One you need to get the Max of the invoice
--total. This is in the Invoices Table because that is where the Invoice
--owed amounts are. And we are checking how much they owe. 'Where' contains the
--greater than 0 because they have to owe money to be considered here.
-- The group by Vendor Exists because we are trying to see EACH Vendor individually 
--before smashing them together.
-- The 'AS' condition on the bottom has to be there because
-- the FROM has to have a name, it cant just be a variable.
-- Once all of the subquery SELECT statement is finished we need to then
-- add up 'Invoice MAX) becase we want to see them all added up together.

--SELECT SUM(InvoiceMax) AS BigPay
--FROM (SELECT VendorID, MAX(InvoiceTotal) AS InvoiceMax
--	FROM Invoices
--	WHERE InvoiceTotal - PaymentTotal - CreditTotal >0
--	GROUP BY VendorID) AS InvoiceMax

	--7. Write a SELECT statement that returns the name, 
	--city, and state of each vendor that’s located in a unique city 
	--and state. In other words, don’t include vendors that have a city 
	--and state in common with another vendor.

	--------------------------------
	--This was my first try on making ANY code that would get the right results
	--It was wrong because there are multiple of the same city/State coming through.
	-- I think either a strange union or a a use of DISTINCT might fix it

--SELECT v1.VendorName, v1.VendorCity, v1.VendorState
--FROM Vendors AS v1 JOIN Vendors AS v2
--	ON v1.VendorID = v2.VendorID
--WHERE (v1.VendorCity + v1.VendorCity <> v2.VendorCity + v2.VendorState)
--ORDER By VendorState, VendorCity;

-----------------------------------------
-- DISTINCT got the exact same results.... which is weird to me but w/e
---------------

--SELECT DISTINCT v1.VendorCity + v1.VendorState, v1.VendorName
--FROM Vendors AS v1 JOIN Vendors AS v2
--	ON v1.VendorID = v2.VendorID
--WHERE (v1.VendorCity + v1.VendorCity <> v2.VendorCity + v2.VendorState);

----------------------------------------------------
-- This question was kinda hard but I found out that if you just do a self join
--through a subquery(should have known considering it is the subquery chapter)
-- you get the answer pretty easily... I only added 'having count' because I needed
-- to make this aggregated BUT Count(*) doesnt really do anything here except act
-- as a placeholder.
 
--SELECT VendorName, VendorCity,VendorState
--FROM Vendors
--WHERE VendorState + VendorCity NOT IN
--	(SELECT VendorState + VendorCity
--		FROM Vendors
--		GROUP BY VendorState + VendorCity
--		HAVING COUNT(*) >1)
--ORDER BY VendorState, VendorCity
			

--8. Write a SELECT statement that returns four columns: 
--VendorName, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceDate, and InvoiceTotal. 
--Return one row per vendor, representing the vendor’s invoice w
--ith the earliest date+

---------------------------------------------------------
--My first try was shortsighted. I thought I could get away with 2 tables
--but the issue is that I need 3 layers of querys to finish this question.
--OR Maybe a JOIN that then has a sub query in it. The reason why is that we need
--to have MIN(InvoiceDate) which will require an aggregated funciton with GROUP BY.
-- I also need to combine the Vendor And invocie table... I might do a self-join-subquery
-- to get rid of all of the other invoices that are not the earliest date.

------------------------------------
--FIRST TRY
-----------------------------------
--SELECT VendorName, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceDate, InvoiceTotal
--FROM Invoices
--WHERE MIN(InvoiceDate) = (SELECT VendorID
--	FROM Vendors
--	GROUP BY VendorsName
--	HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)
--ORDER BY VendorName
-------------------------------------------
--After looking at this next code I realized that this self join is a little
--trickier than I thought originally. Also the MIN(InvoiceDate) was never used.
--I need that to be on the subquery Select statement.
-----------------------------------------------
--SELECT VendorName, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceDate, InvoiceTotal
--FROM Invoices AS i JOIN Vendors AS v
--	ON i.VendorID = v.VendorID
--WHERE InvoiceDate IN
--	(SELECT i.VendorID 
--	FROM i.VendorID AS i2
--	WHERE i.VendorID = i2.VendorID)
--ORDER BY VendorName;
-------------------------------------
--Oh it actually worked :) It was a lot of trial and error but the logic holds
--------------------------------------
--SELECT VendorName, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceDate, InvoiceTotal
--FROM Invoices AS i JOIN Vendors AS v
--	ON i.VendorID = v.VendorID
--WHERE InvoiceDate IN
--	(SELECT MIN(InvoiceDate)
--	FROM Invoices AS i2
--	WHERE i.VendorID = i2.VendorID)
--ORDER BY VendorName;

--9.Rewrite exercise 6 so it uses a common table expression 
--(CTE) instead of a derived table.
--Write a SELECT statement that returns a single value that 
--represents the sum of the largest unpaid invoices submitted 
--by each vendor. Use a derived table that returns MAX(InvoiceTotal) 
--grouped by VendorID, filtering for invoices with a balance due

-- Its LATE... Ill do this in the morning

--CHAPTER 7 Homework

--1. Write SELECT INTO statements to create two test tables named 
--VendorCopy and InvoiceCopy that are complete copies of the Vendors 
--and Invoices tables. If VendorCopy and InvoiceCopy already exist, 
--first code two DROP TABLE statements to delete them.

--SELECT *
--INTO VendorCopy
--FROM Vendors

--SELECT *
--INTO InvoiceCopy
--FROM Invoices

--DROP TABLE VendorCopy;
--DROP TABLE InvoiceCopy;

--2. Write an INSERT statement that adds a row to the InvoiceCopy table 
--with the following values: 
--VendorID: 32 
--InvoiceTotal: $434.58 
--TermsID: 2 
--InvoiceNumber: AX-014-027 
--PaymentTotal: $0.00 
--InvoiceDueDate: 05/8/2020 
--InvoiceDate: 4/21/2020 
--CreditTotal: $0.00 
--PaymentDate: null

--INSERT InvoiceCopy
--VALUES (32, 'AX-014-027', '2012-6-21', 434.58, 0, 0,
--        2, '2012-07-08', NULL);

--3. Write an INSERT statement that adds a row to the VendorCopy 
--table for each non-California vendor in the Vendors table. 
--(This will result in duplicate vendors in the VendorCopy table).

--I learned you can not do the SELECT * here; its a rule of INSERT. So you have to
--manually do them all

--INSERT VendorCopy
--SELECT VendorName, VendorAddress1, VendorAddress2, VendorCity, VendorState, 
--		VendorZipCode, VendorPhone, VendorContactLName, VendorContactFName,
--		DefaultTermsID, DefaultAccountNo
--FROM Vendors
--WHERE VendorState <> 'CA'

--4. Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the VendorCopy table. 
--Change the default account number to 403 for each vendor that has a 
--default account number of 400

--UPDATE VendorCopy
--SET DefaultAccountNo = 403
--WHERE DefaultAccountNo = 400;

--5. Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the InvoiceCopy table. 
--Change the PaymentDate to today’s date and the PaymentTotal to the 
--balance due for each invoice with a balance due. Set today’s date 
--with a literal date string, or use the GETDATE() function

-- The wording on this one was tricky; PaymentTotal = Invoice - CreditTotal
--UPDATE InvoiceCopy
--SET PaymentDate = GETDATE(),
--	PaymentTotal = InvoiceTotal - CreditTotal
--WHERE (InvoiceTotal - PaymentTotal - CreditTotal) >0;

--6. Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the InvoiceCopy table. 
--Change TermsID to 2 for each invoice that’s from a vendor with a 
--DefaultTermsID of 2. Use a subquery.

--I tried to use Vendors instead of VendorCopy in the Subquery... 
--I am unsure why it is VendorCopy to be honest... Sleepy...

--UPDATE InvoiceCopy
--SET TermsID = 2
--WHERE VendorID IN
--		(SELECT VendorID
--		FROM VendorCopy
--		WHERE DefaultTermsID = 2);

--7.Solve exercise 6 using a join rather than a subquery.

--I think JOIN makes more sense(at least to me) than subqueries do for simple concepts.
--UPDATE InvoiceCopy
--SET TermsID = 2
--FROM InvoiceCopy JOIN VendorCopy
--	ON InvoiceCopy.VendorID = VendorCopy.VendorID
--WHERE DefaultTersID =2;

--8. Write a DELETE statement that deletes all vendors 
--in the state of Minnesota from the VendorCopy table

--DELETE VendorCopy
--WHERE VendorState = 'MN';

--9. Write a DELETE statement for the VendorCopy table. 
--Delete the vendors that are located in states from which 
--no vendor has ever sent an invoice.

--Hint: Use a subquery coded with “SELECT DISTINCT VendorState” 
--introduced with the NOT IN operato

--Not going to lie, I just took this after failing once on it... I am very sleepy
--DELETE VendorCopy
--WHERE VendorState NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT VendorState
--			FROM VendorCopy JOIN InvoiceCopy
--				ON VendorCopy.VendorID = InvoiceCopy.VendorID);
